<p>A month had passed and Gabriel was content with the progress of his students. They were catching up well with the new concepts being taught to them, and with an actual plant beside them, through which they could carry their observations out, it made the process of learning interactive and fun for them. His own pot of Dahlia was kept near the window, from where it got enough sunshine to grow, and he watered it everyday, before class. 
<p>
The initiates entered, and occupied their seats, and Gabriel stood up, smiling. <b>"Good afternoon initiates. Today we have a busy day ahead of us! We will be going to the Lab today, but before I'd like you to take out your books!"</b> He announced, his voice loud over the chatting initiates. Once there was decorum, he flipped open the pages and announced  the topic for the day. <b>"Plant Cells. That is what we will be studying about today. So what is a cell? It is the smallest and basic unit of life. All life starts from cells, and hence they are known as the building blocks of life."</b> <p>

He turned behind, the classroom walls had been covered with posters of differnet biological processes, and even models, and he pointed at the poster which had the diagram of the plant cells. <b>"This is a plant cell. There are differences between animal and plant cells, which you can find in your biology books, and then hand me an essay. Now I would like all of you to proceed towards the Biology Lab, so I can show you a real life plant cell, through a microscope."</B> Gabriel lead the initiates towards the lab, and once everyone had settled, he started letting the students in, one by one, giving them the chance to view a plant cell. Many were able to point out the nucleus, the cell wall, and the vacuoles, and Gabriel assisted them wherever help was required.
<p>
<b>"I hope that you all had paid attention in today's class. The plant cells are the very first topic we should be aware about, since cells are the basics of biology, and you will be needing this information through a long way."</b> He concluded, and the class came to an end.
